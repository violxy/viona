<p>The woodcutter dropped his axe into the spring.
<p>His superior said, “Why did you drop it?”
<p>“Eh, S-Sorry…,” the woodcutter said.

<p>“Granny, why are your ears so big?”
<p>“All the better to hear the idiots making claims, my dear.”

<p>Momotaro took a dog, monkey, and pheasant with him to journey to the demon island. This is because humans have high labor costs, and members of the same species will form a labor union.

<p>The devil said to Jesus, “Are you the child genius Jesus? If that’s the case, turn this stone into gold.”
<p>Jesus said to the people, “If you do not buy this stone, misfortune will befall you.” He sold it for a high price, used the gold he got to buy a golden expanding bar and brought it to the devil.
<p>Jesus was thus hired by the devil’s company as a full time employee.
